        About this book
    </p>
    <p>
This book consists of two parts:

Part 1 is a quick start for TypeScript that teaches you the essentials quickly.
Part 2 digs deeper into the language and covers many important topics in detail.
This book is not a reference, it is meant to complement the official TypeScript handbook.

Required knowledge: You must know JavaScript. If you want to refresh your knowledge: My book “JavaScript for impatient programmers” is free to read online.
